## Project Timeline
Orbit was coded over a 5 day period in February 2018, planned from wireframes through to each MVP:

## Technologies
Conceived as a `vanilla JS` project, Orbit was expanded to include the gorgeous visual experience afforded through the integration of `Three.js`


## Future Plans
  + Duplicate the existing functionality to include "powerups" as a complement to the existing destructive asteroids.
  + Awesome 80s Synthy-Soundtrack!
